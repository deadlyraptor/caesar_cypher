Caesar Cypher by Javier Alejandro Chavez

This simple script will encrypt any word (or phrase) a user inputs using a Caesar shift. The shift used is 3.


Bugs:

1. The only check on the user's input is a length check, i.e., len(raw_input) > 0. This means user can input a non-alphabetic character and the code will simply print the input as is, i.e., raw_input = !!! then code prints !!!.

Features to implement:

1. Decryption.
